Manning GWT In Practice Ch5 gwtipXfire project
-------------------------------------------------------------

This project contains the code for the SOAP server used in Chapter 5. It is 
packaged as a NetBeans project, which you can open using 5.5.x or 6.x. 

When you first open the project, you will get a notification that there are 
reference problems. You need to right-click on the project icon in NetBeans and
select "Resolve Reference Problems." The JARs you need are in the ./lib folder 
of the project.

You will need this project deployed to your NetBeans Tomcat instance for the
examples in the Chapter 5 Examples project to run.
