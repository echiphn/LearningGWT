Manning GWT In Practice Ch5 Applet project
-------------------------------------------------------------

This project contains the code for the SOAP client Applet for Chapter 5. It is 
packaged as a NetBeans project, which you can open using 5.5.x or 6.x. 

When you first open the project, you will get a notification that there are 
reference problems. You need to right-click on the project icon in NetBeans and
select "Resolve Reference Problems." The JARs you need are in the ./lib folder 
of the project.

Once this is built, you need to place the applet and its dependencies in the 
public/applet folder of the Examples project. For convenience, this has been 
done for you. This project serves just to allow you to inspect the source code
for the applet.
