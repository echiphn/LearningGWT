Manning GWT In Practice Ch5 Notes
-------------------------------------------------------------

"Other Techniques for Talking to Servers" includes several examples
that demonstrate methods of communicating between a GWT client and a 
server backend that is *not* using GWT RPC (that is covered in Chapter 3).

The projects in this chapter use the NetBeans IDE and the GWT4NB plugin.

All projects included here have NetBeans support files (and libs) and can
be imported. (Were built with a Mac, so you may have to fix dependencies for
gwt-dev-PLATFORM, where platform is "windows", "linux" or "max" when you import.) 

This folder contains 3 projects for use with the chapter examples. First is the 
gwtipXfire folder. This contains the simple SOAP service we are using as an 
example. You will want to open this project and run it on your NetBeans tomcat
instance to use the Examples project. 

The Examples project contains the GWT code we discuss in this chapter, as well 
as the source FLA for the Flash client.

The Applet project contains just the source and dependencies for the Applet.
A built version of this code, as well as all the dependencies is included in the
public.applet package of the Examples project.

Please the the respective README files in each of these folders for more 
information.

(Also see ../README.txt.)
