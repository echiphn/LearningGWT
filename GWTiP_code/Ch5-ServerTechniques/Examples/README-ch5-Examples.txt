Manning GWT In Practice Ch5 Examples project
-------------------------------------------------------------

This project contains the GWT example code for the Chapter 5 examples. It is 
packaged as a NetBeans project that you can open with 5.5.x or 6.x. When you 
first open the project, it will alert you to Reference problems. You will need
to point the GWT library and the gwt-dev-*.jar references to the appropriate 
locations on your hard drive.

Inside the public/applet folder are all the JAR files needed for the Applet 
example. The project and source for this in contained in a parallel directory.

the public/flash folder contains both the compiled SWF file and the source FLA
file for the Flash SOAP client. To use either of these projects, you need to 
first deploy the gwtipXfire project to your Tomcat. It is also contained in a 
parallel directory.
