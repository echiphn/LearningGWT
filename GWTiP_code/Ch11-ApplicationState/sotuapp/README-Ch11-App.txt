Manning GWT In Practice Ch11 SOTU App
-------------------------------------------------------------

This project contains the code Swing App used in Chapter 11. It is 
packaged as a NetBeans project, which you can open using 5.5.x or 6.x. 

When you first open the project, you will get a notification that there are 
reference problems. You need to right-click on the project icon in NetBeans and
select "Resolve Reference Problems." The JARs you need are in the ./lib folder 
of the project.

Once you have resolved the reference issue, running this app will launch the 
application. You will need to correct the server URL if necessary, and enter
the conversation name and password you created using the Web application.
